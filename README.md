## 1. About
This repo contains the code used to write this [blog post](https://medium.com/@gabrielsgaspar/women-in-tech-a-look-at-the-stack-overflow-annual-developer-surveys-7ffacf0586c2). The post was written as part of the necessary requirements for the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). Please refer to the syllabus on this webpage for further details about the degree, the requirements or this specific project.

The main file in this repo is the [analysis notebook](notebook/analysis.ipynb). It explains how data was downloaded, assessed, cleaned and finally visualized for this project. The [download folder](download) contains functions that are used to download survey data and shapefiles for maps. These are saved in the [data folder](data). Lastly, the [figures folder](figures) contains all the plots and animations generated by the [analysis notebook](notebook/analysis.ipynb).

## 3. The Blog Post
This [blog post](https://medium.com/@gabrielsgaspar/women-in-tech-a-look-at-the-stack-overflow-annual-developer-surveys-7ffacf0586c2) looks at the past five editions (2016 - 2020) of the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and provides some insight into the following questions:
- Are more women participating in the Stack Overflow Annual Developer surveys?
- Are men happier than women in the tech world?
- What countries have the highest job satisfaction for women?

The motivation behind these questions comes from the understanding that the tech industry has issues with the representation of certain minority groups. Among others, women do not have a lot of space in the tech world.

This blog post uses animations in order to visualize how female participation in the surveys and job satisfaction changed (or not) over time. It also looks at how job satisfaction rates for women is spread out around the globe by looking at maps.
